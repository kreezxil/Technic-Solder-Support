The following is based on my experience in trying to follow the instructions at Docs.Solder.io and ultimately made concise for you. I take no responsibility for any damage or distress you might cause yourself or others while following this document.

1. Make sure you are using a fresh clean installation of Ubuntu 14.04 server 32 or 64 bit version. It will come preinstalled with a LAMP stack which is what we want as a base.

2. Log into your server as root and do the following

        cd /root

3. First update you apt repository

        apt-get update

4. The Apache part is garbage for us and we are going to use something else to manage it. So let’s get rid of Apache.

        apt-get remove --purge apache*

5. Install nano as we are going to need it.

        apt-get install nano

6. We are going to use Vesta CP a free control panel to setup the web server.

        wget http://vestacp.com/pub/vst-install.sh

7. Now run it

        bash vst-install.sh

8. This wil take about 15 minutes, when it is done at the bottom will be an address similar to https://your.domain.com:8083, a user name, and a temporary password.
We can start by going to the address given, logging in and I suggest changing the password. Change nothing else!

9. Become admin

        su admin

10. Now goto the following as it is where your Technic Solder will live. Whenever I say hit tab key, that what I want you to do, actually hit it and then keep typing the other stuff.

        cd ~/web/hit tab key/public_html

11. Next we have to get Composer by using *whenever you use sudo it’ll ask for the current users password.

        sudo wget https://getcomposer.org/installer

12. Now you have to install composer by doing

        sudo php installer

13. Now we need to update the composer

        sudo php composer.phar self-update

14. With that out of the we will use git to get a copy of the official Technic Solder structure and support files.

        git clone https://github.com/TechnicPack/TechnicSolder.git

15. Now enter the Technic Solder directory

        cd TechnicSolder

16. This part used to be different and if you follow the Getting Started guide it’ll really mess you up. We need to edit the TechnicSolder config files first. So go to that folder now with

        cd app

17. The config directory is not yet set up. Thankfully there is an example config directory that we will copy

        cp -r config-sample config

18. Great job so far! Now do

        cd config

19. This comes from the initial configuration at the bottom the file at Getting Started, first we need to edit the solder.php file

        nano solder.php

20. Find the line that has and change it to your actual path of the for facing directory and change mirror_url to the name of your webserver

        'repo_location' => '/home/admin/web/your.domain.tld/public_html/TechnicSolder/public/',

        /**
         * Mirror Location
         *
         * This is where the launcher will be told to search for your files. If                                                                                                                                                              your
         * repo location is already a URL you can use the same location here.
         *
         **/
        'mirror_url' => 'http://your.domain.tld/',

21. Now you want to save these changes

        ctrl+X, Y, enter

22. Next we need to edit app.php

        nano app.php

23. Find the line that says ‘url’ and change it’s value to the same value you used for ‘mirror_url’ on the previous instruction

        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Application URL
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | This URL is used by the console to properly generate URLs when using
        | the Artisan command line tool. You should set this to the root of
        | your application so that it is used when running Artisan tasks.
        |
        */

        'url' => 'http://your.domain.tld/TechnicSolder/public',

24. Save it

        ctrl+X, Y, enter

25. Go back to the TechnicSolder folder

        cd ../..

26. Finally we get to install TechnicSolder, seriously. Yeah. Run the following twice, it trips out on the first run, so running it again makes everything happy.

        #run this twice!
        sudo php ../composer.phar install --no-dev --no-interaction

27. We are not done, but we are very close! This part will set up the tables. Please do both commands in sequence. The first command may kick back with blocks of red hilited words, ignore it and its output if it happens.

        php artisan migrate::install; php artisan migrate

28. Answer yes when asked

29. We are going to set the owners and permissions, please do both commands.

        cd ..
        sudo chown -R admin:admin .

30. Let’s make some symbolic links in the /home/admin folder that will make our lives easier when we next join the server. Where I say hit tab key, hit the tab key

        cd ~
        mkdir web/hit tab key/public_html/TechnicSolder/public/mods
        mkdir web/hit tab key/public_html/TechnicSolder/public/temp
        ln -s web/hit tab key/public_html/TechnicSolder/public/mods solder
        ln -s web/hit tab key/public_html/TechnicSolder/public/temp temp

31. Congratulations! You now have Technic Solder installed on your server. Now go to http://your.domain.tld/Technic/public/ in your browser and use the following credentials. Make sure to create a new admin user with a non-admin name and to delete the existing admin account. Then log back in with the new one.

        user: admin@admin.com
        pass: admin
        
Note:
        At this point you can resume following instructions elsewhere, however, if you do life will suck for you as the maintainer! The reason is that Technic Solder has no web interface for inputting a mod. In other words, the web interface will not download a mod. You have to either download the mod to your computer and then upload it the server in to the correct directory under /var/www/html/TechnicSolder/public/mods and it must be uploaded as a zip and further the zip must contain a very explicit internal directory structure. You might be thinking, “Jesus Christ!” while you bash your head against your desk.
