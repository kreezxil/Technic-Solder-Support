You've got your Technic Solder Distribution Server configured and accessible. But now you need to easily maintain it. Sadly it doesn't have a proper web interface for this and therefore the maintenance is done from the shell side. These instructions will walk you through that process of getting this maintenance environ up and going along with the help of some scripts I have I designed for this purpose. This additional guide assumes you have followed my Technic Solder installation instructions. If you came here from somewhere else and it doesn't work; I won't be able to help you very much. You'll have to figure it out, fork this project, make your changes to the instructions, create a pull request, and I'll merge them in such a way as to be all-inclusive.

1. Log in to your server as admin and go to the mods folder

        cd solder

2. using wget do to copy the script into this folder

        wget https://github.com/kreezxil/Technic-Solder-Support/blob/master/Scripts/mkArchive.sh

4. Make it executable

        chmod a+x mkArchive.sh

5. Make sure you Zip installed

        #on deb/ubuntu based systems
        [sudo] apt-get install zip

        #on redhat based systems
        sudo yum install zip

6. The script can be executed without arguments in which case it’ll prompt for each nitty gritty detail. However, you can execute all of the arguments in a single line in the same order they appear with the menu. A typical invocation might look like

        ./mkArchive 1 modslug-name "version" downloadlink

        *:quotes only needed if version has spaces
        **:this is your database, your modslug-name doesn't have to match the case or the name, but it should do so closely or else you'll have a problem when you return to this later

7. Sometimes you get a mod that doesn’t have a link to give the script, instead it is downloaded on your computer, in this case you will ftp to your distribution server as root. Your remote folder will be /root and there is a temp folder shortcut we made earlier, double click that or enter it, and then upload the mod you downloaded to this directory and then you would use the script on the server as

        ./mkArchive.sh 1 modslug-name "version"

        and at this point it will ask you if the mod is in temp and you will say yes and then it will ask you if there is more than one part and I realized a couple of days ago that is stupid, so whether or not there is more than one file just answer 'Y' and hit enter.

        now copy this version number to the place in the Technic Solder app where it asks for the version number. And hit "add mod", it should be added to your mod database and now you can add it to your modpack.

Let’s talk about the script some more. The first argument which is a number corresponds to the first menu you encounter when you run the script without arguments. These control how the individual things you link in or upload are configured and packaged for distribution to your clients.

    echo "Pack Type:"
    echo
    echo "1. Standard Mod"
    echo "2. Lite Mod"
    echo "3. Config Pack"
    echo "   - You must have uploaded all configs in"
    echo "     the structure required by the mod to"
    echo "     the TEMP path"
    echo "4. Forge Jar"
    echo "5. Minecraft Root"
    echo "   - servers.dat, options.txt etc. ..."
    echo

As you can see the number ‘1’ means we are building a standard mod archive. You can see that the script also provides for the other types of files you might want the users of your modpack to have. In the case of a Config Pack you will have to upload the configs to the temp folder. Don’t upload the config folder itself from your Minecraft client but instead a sub-element such as a subfolder or file that is in the config folder. When it asks for a slug I would just go with “my-config” or something along that nature and use the version section for differentiation.

    ./mkArchive.sh 3 my-config-pack techno-magic-1.8.9-1.2

In this way you can have multiple config packs for the various mod packs and version of your mod packs.
